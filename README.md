Assumptions

Users can browse Professionals without authentication (login will be added later).

Booking APIs are not yet integrated ‚Äî booking flow is mocked locally.

Professionals have basic profile details (name, category, price) and can be filtered.

Decisions

Used BLoC for predictable state management and testability.

Chose repository + DTO/mappers structure to allow easy backend integration later.

UI kept minimal but production-style to focus on feature correctness.

Shortcuts (due to time)

Hardcoded/mock data used in place of API calls.

Error handling is simplified (only essential user-facing errors shown).
